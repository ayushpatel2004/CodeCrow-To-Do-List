so here comes our To-Do App which will help u remember which task you have to complete adding a task in it is very simple ( just one click ), and whenever a task is completed just click on ```"TASK COMPLETED"```.

## Technology

So how was our Android App built? ,

well, we used some combination of Software like Android Studio & IntelliJ for writing our Java Codes & manipulating XML files, Making our first app was really tough work for all of us, but we enjoyed it :) .

about designing and icons, well the most genius website ( Google ) helped us to find correct resources ( Icon and Background Pic, etc ).

Worked with Databases , to assure that once u close the app , all the tasks which are not completed are still there.

Android Studio did most of the work as it is loaded with good features for UI, and of course, correcting incorrect Syntax was another Headache but it was our best friend during this development session.

## Additional Feature
